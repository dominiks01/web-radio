    2.4" 240x320 SPI TFT RGB display (ST7789)
    VS1053b audio decoder module
    MB-102 breadboard + power supply
    Connecting wires
    Speaker
    PAM8403 2x3W 5V audio amplifier module
    Power supply

Software Requirements

    Arduino IDE with libraries for ESP32
    Adafruit_ST7789.h library for the TFT display
    VS1053 library for the audio decoder
    WiFi library for internet connectivity
